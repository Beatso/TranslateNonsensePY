# Translate Nonsense
Simple python project to translate things through google translate too many times until they break and become nonsense.
Two options: insert a link from a raw [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), or add the string directly into the program.

## Technical
Built in Python 3.7.3.
Requires the googletrans module to work.
